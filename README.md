## RBG Colors Explained:
The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.

## The game was a project of Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp
The project is built on JavaScript and utilizes CSS Flexbox to generate boxes with random colors. Built-in JavaScript math functions are used to randomize RGB colors to re-generate in every new game.
